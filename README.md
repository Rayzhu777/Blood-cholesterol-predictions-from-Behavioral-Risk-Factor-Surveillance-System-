This is a group project. 
The dataset comes from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a health-related telephone survey, that collects data from U.S. residents about their life habits and risk behaviors regarding subjectsâ€™ health. BRFSS is a large health survey system that continuously completes more than 400,000 adult interviews each year. The dataset we will be using is the data from 2015.
